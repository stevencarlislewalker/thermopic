Description: A ThermoPic is a picture of thermal habitat in a lake. 
  This software serves three purposes. First, it predicts the seasonal 
  temperature cycle in lakes based on easily measured variables. Second, 
  it calculates and reports thermal habitat statistics. Third, it generates 
  a ThermoPic plot. The model used to predict temperature is referred to as
  the Seasonal Temperature Model (STM). It was created by Minns et al. (2016)
  based on data from lakes in the province of Ontario (Canada).
